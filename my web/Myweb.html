    <p><span> I chose to take up the Full Stack Development Program as I wanted to change my career.
     I look at myself and wonder what I have become today after this program and I also feel so proud about myself.<br> I was also 
    working yet took this course as a full <br> I have worked for eight years in the industry and as a woman sometimes it's tough m as there are multiple things to handle at once. <br>
    But the schedule of the program was well-structured and perfect to be carried out

    <p>Though I had exposure to CSS and HTML, I started to learn JS only after this course. I am from Biotechnology, but during my Post Graduation I had started to learn Python. I had basic knowledge and I have evolved through this program.Transparency was one thing that I liked the most in this course. The mentors' support was highly commendable. We could evidently see that they have been investing genuine efforts in our growth. Overall, this has been a good experience for me</p>

    <p> liked the structure of the program the most. The content of the program was so good, and the sequence of the curriculum was smooth and helped me learn better. Though we could take this course on any other platform, this is the best program that I found out to be well-structured that made the understanding very easy.
        I would definitely recommend this program to others, this is a great program. I expected Placement Season to be stressful, however with the support that I received from the mentors, it felt like a cakewalk
